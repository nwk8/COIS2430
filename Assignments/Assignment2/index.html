    <h1 id="progressive-enhancement">Progressive Enhancement</h1>

    <p>
      With a multitude of browsers comes a multitude of levels of support for
      the web standards. In fact, no browser has implemented all the standards
      100%, and there are always new technologies that are slowly gaining steam.
      Furthermore, users can set their own browser preferences, so they may have
      a browser that supports JavaScript but have chosen to turn it off. The
      point here is that we are faced with a wide range of browser
      capabilities—from only basic HTML support to all the bells and whistles.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="term">Progressive enhancement</span> is one strategy for
      dealing with unknown browser capabilities (see <strong>Note</strong>).
      When designing with progressive enhancement, you start with a baseline
      experience that makes the content or core functionality available to even
      the most rudimentary browsers or assistive devices. From there, you layer
      on more advanced features for the browsers that can handle them. You might
      finish with some “nice to have” effects, like animation or wrapping text
      around images in interesting shapes, that enhance the experience for users
      with the most advanced browsers, but aren't really critical to the brand
      or message.

      <h2>Strategies</h2>

      <p>
        <span class="term">Progressive enhancement</span> is an approach that
        informs all aspects of page design and production, including HTML, CSS,
        and JavaScript:

          When an HTML document is written in logical order and its elements are
          marked up in a meaningful way, it will be usable on the widest range
          of browsing environments, including the oldest browsers, future
          browsers, and mobile and assistive devices. It may not look exactly
          the same, but the important thing is that your content is available.
          It also ensures that
          <a
            href="https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/how-search-works/ranking-results/"
            >search engines like Google</a
          >
          will catalog the content correctly. A clean HTML document with its
          elements accurately and thoroughly described is the foundation for
          accessibility.
        </dd>

        <dt>Styling strategy</dt>
        <dd>
          You can create layers of experience simply by taking advantage of the
          way browsers parse style sheet rules. Without going into too much
          technical detail, you can write a style rule that makes an element
          background red, but also include a style that gives it a cool gradient
          (a blend from one color to another) for browsers that know how to
          render gradients. Or you can use a cutting-edge CSS selector to
          deliver certain styles only to cutting-edge browsers. The knowledge
          that browsers simply ignore properties and rules they don't understand
          gives you license to innovate without bringing older browsers to their
          knees. You just have to be mindful of styling the baseline experience
          first, then adding improvements once the minimum requirements are met.
        </dd>

        <dt>Scripting strategy</dt>
        <dd>
          As with other web technologies, there are discrepancies in how
          browsers handle JavaScript (particularly on non-desktop devices), and
          some users opt to turn it off entirely. The first rule in progressive
          enhancement is to make sure basic functionality—such as linking from
          page to page or accomplishing essential tasks like data submission via
          forms—is intact even when JavaScript is off. In this way, you ensure
          the baseline experience, and enhance it when JavaScript is available.
