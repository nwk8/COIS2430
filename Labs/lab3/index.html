      Navigation sections with lots of links can be challenging for
      accessibility, since someone with a screen-reader has to listen to the
      entire list at the top of every page. One approach taken to minimize this
      accessibility problem is something called a skip link.

    <p>
      A <dfn>skip link</dfn> is a hyperlink placed before the navigation that
      links to the main header after the navigation. A skip link is hidden from
      sighted users with CSS, but makes it possible for those with screen reader
      to skip the navigation and continue on with the page.
