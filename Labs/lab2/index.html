  <h1>Legendary Nanaimo Bars</h1>

  <p>
    This creamy, chocolatey treat's origin is elusive, shrouded in mystery, and claimed by many as their own. Of
    course, we know that Nanaimo Bars originated in Nanaimo BC, or they would be called New York Bars, or New Brunswick
    Bars.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're interested in the facts and fables of this slice of heaven, you can read all the conjecture on Wikipedia
    about Nanaimo Bars. If you actually own or know the whereabouts of a cookbook or other publication dating back to
    the early 50s or beyond, we would very much like to see it and put an end to all this confusion with documented
    proof.

    In 1986, Nanaimo Mayor Graeme Roberts, in conjunction with Harbour Park Mall, initiated a contest to find the
    ultimate Nanaimo Bar Recipe. During the four-week long contest, almost 100 different variations of the famous
    confection were submitted. <strong>The winner:</strong> <em>Joyce Hardcastle.</em>
